Optimisation techniques
=======================

Literature overview next week.

Find papers or whatever.

Start modeling the mathematical description (due the lab after the next).

Begin with input/output file on toledo.

	There will be extra parameters like time to pick someone up.
	Penalty for not picking someone up.
	...

List of stops: put pick up and drop off locations in the list.


Brainstorm
----------

Every person has a bunch of pick-up and drop-off locations based on walking

Drivers have just one pick-up and drop-off.


Limo search
-----------

- Tabu search for the real-world carpooling problem (pdf)
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search
	- Is simpler because there is only one destination

- Theory and Practice in Large Carpooling Problems
	- When drivers are known it is an "assignment problem" in bipartite graphs
	- The problem presented in this paper is identical to ours.
	  There are multiple origins/destinations, with (earliest) departure and arrival times.
	  Only walking distances are again not considered.
	  Here every passenger has maximal detour distance. Does this make search easier?
	- Reference 5, 7 and 8 from this paper are very interesting.
	- Has interesting way of matching people.

- The car pooling problem: Heuristic algorithms based on savings functions
	- Old paper, very high level, theoretical

- Estimating scalability issues while finding an optimal assignment for carpooling
	- More details on how to implement an algorithm. Same research as "Theory and Practice..."
	- Hasselt University... with data from Flanders.

Formulation (math model)
------------------------

- What are the decision variables?
- What is the linear model?
